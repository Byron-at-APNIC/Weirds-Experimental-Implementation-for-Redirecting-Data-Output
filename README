Note from the Author:

This is a django 1.2 app that provides an extremely basic and careless
proxy to convert org.whois-servers.net output into an as yet unspecified
weirds names-json format.  It worked on the three test zones I tried it on,
and broke badly when I typo'd a zone name, since it has no error checking.
